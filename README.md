## M0 : Project Overview

The convergence of conflict and infrastructure collapse has created a global crisis, leaving millions of children not only out of school but completely **without safe, lit spaces to shelter or learn.** This systemic failure is driven by the collapse of both education and energy systems.

This project offers an interdisciplinary solution: it integrates global education and electrification datasets to power the design of modular, solar-powered learning hubs. These hubs are fundamentally designed as transitional infrastructure, ensuring the stabilization of community life and education during the crucial post-conflict recovery phase.

### Education in Crisis

Conflict has created an unprecedented global education emergency:

- **Scale:** Over **85 million school-age children** are out of school globally due to conflict.  
- **Infrastructure Failure:** Education infrastructure is under systematic attack, with a **44% surge** in attacks on facilities and **up to 95% destruction** in active war zones (e.g., Gaza).  
- **Obstacle:** Traditional power sources (grid/diesel) are **easily targeted or logistically impossible to supply**, while education remains critically underfunded—receiving only **3% of total humanitarian aid**.

  <summary><b>The Problem</b></summary>

- Schools in war-torn areas are often converted into emergency shelters, disrupting education [GCPEA, Education under Attack 2024](https://protectingeducation.org/publication/education-under-attack-2024/)
- Overcrowding worsens as classrooms are repurposed for survival needs, particularly documented in high-density crisis zones [UNRWA, Situation Reports (2023-2024)](https://www.unrwa.org/test-table)
- A lack of reliable electricity, symptomatic of collapsing infrastructure and low electrification rates, leaves schools unsafe and unusable after sunset.[ World Bank Group, Accelerating Sub-Saharan Africa Energy Access, 2022](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/11/09/world-bank-group-announces-major-initiative-to-electrify-sub-saharan-africa-with-distributed-renewable-energy)

  <summary><b>Why It Matters</b></summary>

Solving this problem is vital for **protection**, **immediate relief**, and **long-term recovery**:

- **Protecting a Generation:** Education provides a safe space, shielding millions of children from exploitation and helping prevent the emergence of a “lost generation.”  
- **Resilient & Cost-Effective Power:** Solar PV is the only **decentralized, attack-resilient**, and **cost-effective** energy source—freeing up critical humanitarian funds for learning resources.  
- **Critical Dual-Use Infrastructure:** A **Solar + Battery Energy Storage (BES)** system ensures schools operate **24/7** as classrooms by day and **community or medical shelters by night**, laying a foundational path for **peace and reconstruction**.
