## [M0 : Project Overview]()  
  
In conflict zones, the collapse of education and energy systems leaves millions of children without safe spaces to learn. [UNESCO, 2023](https://www.unesco.org/en/education/emergencies).  
This project uses global data on schooling and electricity access [UNICEF, 2022](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/education-in-emergencies/) [IEA, 2022](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-access-outlook-2022) to propose **modular, solar-powered learning hubs** that keep education alive even in times of crisis.  


<details>
<summary>The Problem</summary>

- Schools in war-torn areas are often converted into emergency shelters, disrupting education [UNHCR, 2022](https://www.unhcr.org/education.html).  
- Overcrowding worsens as classrooms are repurposed for survival needs [UNICEF, 2023](https://www.unicef.org/education/emergencies).  
- A lack of reliable electricity leaves schools unsafe and unusable after sunset [IEA, 2022](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-access-outlook-2022).  

</details>

<details>
<summary> The Idea</summary>

By combining **data science and architectural design**, this project proposes **solar-powered, dual-use schools** that can:  
- Provide safe, lit shelter at night [UNESCO, 2023](https://www.unesco.org/en/education/emergencies)  
- Function as classrooms during the day [UNICEF, 2022](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/education-in-emergencies/)  
- Use solar energy for lighting, device charging, and essential power needs [IRENA, 2023](https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Solar-PV).

<summary>The Approach</summary>

1. **Data Storytelling** — visualize UN/NGO data on school closures, displacement, and electricity scarcity [UNHCR, 2022](https://www.unhcr.org/education.html).  
2. **Analysis** — assess solar energy feasibility in regions such as Sudan, Gaza, and Chad [World Bank, 2022](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/).  
3. **Design** — create adaptable architectural prototypes for solar-enabled learning shelters [Architectural Review, 2022](https://www.architectural-review.com/).  
4. **Visualization** — integrate data maps, charts, and architectural diagrams into an interactive narrative [MIT Civic Data Design Lab, 2021](https://civicdatadesignlab.mit.edu/).

<summary>Why It Matters</summary>

Education is a human right that should not be suspended by crisis [UNICEF, 2023](https://www.unicef.org/education).  
This project demonstrates how **data-driven design** can create **resilient, solar-powered spaces** that protect children, sustain learning, and support communities even in conflict zones [UNESCO, 2023](https://www.unesco.org/en/education/emergencies).
