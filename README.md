## M0 : Project Overview

The convergence of conflict and infrastructure collapse has created a global crisis, leaving millions of children not only out of school but completely **without safe, lit spaces to shelter or learn.** This systemic failure is driven by the collapse of both education and energy systems.

This project offers an interdisciplinary solution: it integrates global education and electrification datasets to power the design of modular, solar-powered learning hubs. These hubs are fundamentally designed as transitional infrastructure, ensuring the stabilization of community life and education during the crucial post-conflict recovery phase.

### The Problem

- Schools in war-torn areas are often converted into emergency shelters, disrupting education [GCPEA, Education under Attack 2024](https://protectingeducation.org/publication/education-under-attack-2024/)
- Overcrowding worsens as classrooms are repurposed for survival needs, particularly documented in high-density crisis zones [UNRWA, Situation Reports (2023-2024)](https://www.unrwa.org/test-table)
- A lack of reliable electricity, symptomatic of collapsing infrastructure and low electrification rates, leaves schools unsafe and unusable after sunset.[ World Bank Group, Accelerating Sub-Saharan Africa Energy Access, 2022](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/11/09/world-bank-group-announces-major-initiative-to-electrify-sub-saharan-africa-with-distributed-renewable-energy)

  <summary><b>The Idea</b></summary>

By combining **data science and architectural design**, this project explores how **solar-powered, dual-use schools** can:  
- Function as safe, lit shelters at night [Sphere Handbook, 2018](https://www.ndsu.edu/sites/default/files/fileadmin/emgt/The_Sphere_Project_Handbook_2011.pdf)  
- Operate as classrooms during the day [INEE, 2024](https://inee.org/minimum-standards)  
- Harness solar energy for lighting, charging, and essential power needs [IFC, Renewable Energy in Gaza](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/un-global-climate-action-awards/financing-for-climate-friendly-investment/self-reliance-solar)  

Through **spatial design simulations** and **geospatial/electrification data analysis**, the project develops prototypes adaptable to different conflict contexts.

  <summary><b>Why It Matters</b></summary>

Education is a fundamental right that should not collapse under crisis [UNICEF, School not in session for millions of children around the world.](https://www.unicef.org/stories/school-session-millions-children-around-world)
This project shows how **data-informed architecture** can deliver **resilient, solar-powered spaces** that:  
- Safeguard children and communities,  
- Sustain learning during disruption,  
- And demonstrate the role of **interdisciplinary problem-solving** at the nexus of **data science, energy, and design**
