# Domain Study: Guide

To do meaningful research in a domain, you need to learn what others already do
and don't understand in this area. Use this folder to organize your group's
understanding of your research domain including: your own summaries, helpful
PDFs, links you found helpful, ...

This folder is different from `/notes` because it contains _only_ information
about your research domain. When deciding what goes here, ask yourself this
question: _Would someone need to know this to understand our research?_

## README.md

Use this folder's README to document all the notes and resources in this folder.
Someone shouldn't need to read through _everything_ to find what they need.
