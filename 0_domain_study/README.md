> Of the 234 million school-age children affected by conflict globally, **85 million children are completely out of school.**

_The figures are “unprecedented,” Helena Murseli, who leads the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) Global Education in Emergencies team, told [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165417)_ _“These are not isolated incidents. They are part of a global pattern of escalating conflict that affects children's right to learn,” she said._

### [Background: Education in Crisis](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165417)
- Armed conflicts have left millions of children without schooling, eroding both their safety and future prospects. Education is not only vital for learning but also for stability, protection, and recovery in crisis settings.

  - **Sudan** faces the world’s largest education emergency, with 19 million children out of school and 90% of schools closed. UNICEF and partners are restoring access through Makanna centres, solar-powered learning tools, and a $400M UNESCO plan.
      - The organization also utilises solar-powered tablets for education, _“perfect for a country with more than 10 hours of daily sunshine,” said Ms. Murseli._
  - In **Gaza**, [95%](https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/59/26?_gl=1*dbrfff*_ga*MTYzMDA1NDk5OS4xNzU5NjU1MzA4*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*czE3NTk2NTUzMDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTk2NTU3OTAkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_S5EKZKSB78*czE3NTk2NTUzMDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTk2NTU3OTckajM0JGwwJGgw) of schools are destroyed, leaving [660,000](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-177-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem) children without education. Temporary spaces, recycled materials, and digital tools are being used to sustain learning for thousands.
  - In **Ukraine**, 5.3 million children face disrupted education, with many relying on online or hybrid learning amid attacks and power shortages. UNICEF supports safe underground classrooms and catch-up programs.

Despite urgent needs, education receives only 3% of humanitarian aid, even as funding is expected to drop further. Without investment, millions risk becoming a lost generation—deprived of the skills to rebuild their societies.

> In the short and long-term, the consequences of missing out on education during violent crises are severe.

### [**Education in Emergencies**](https://www.unicef.org/education/emergencies)

> Education is a lifeline for children in crises.  
> Children in conflict zones face ongoing attacks and loss of education as wars persist, threatening the future of entire generations. Without schooling, they are vulnerable to exploitation and unable to rebuild their countries, deepening the crisis.  

The **solution** lies in protecting education itself. Schools must remain safe spaces that shield children from violence and offer hope for stability and peace.  

The [**Safe Schools Declaration**](https://safeschoolsdeclaration.org), launched in **2015**, is a global political commitment endorsed by **121 States** to protect students, teachers, and education facilities during armed conflict and prevent their military use. It promotes restoring safe access to education and fostering respect and inclusion across communities.  

[**UNICEF**](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/regular-attacks-put-gaza-schools-turned-shelters-frontlines-war) plays a key role by helping implement the Declaration—developing school safety plans, rehabilitating schools, training teachers, and providing psychosocial and learning support. It also partners with governments and organizations to ensure learning continues through innovative methods like radio education programs in crisis-affected regions.

### 1. Introduction: Education as the First Casualty of War

Education is a fundamental human right and an essential protection mechanism in emergencies. It offers children and youth stability, psychosocial support, and a pathway to future recovery. However, in conflict settings, education is systematically targeted and disrupted. This paper examines the devastating scale of educational collapse in war zones and establishes that decentralized, reliable solar energy is the most resilient and viable solution for ensuring educational continuity and facilitating post-conflict recovery.

### 2. The Scale of the Crisis and its Physical Manifestation  

Conflict severely impairs education by displacing students and teachers, and critically, by destroying the core physical infrastructure necessary for learning. [UN News – 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165417)

#### A. Out-of-School Figures and Systemic Barriers  

- **Global Displacement:** Over [52 million](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158561) children in countries affected by conflict are estimated to be out of school, representing a massive denial of opportunity for a generation.  

- **Current Emergencies:** Children in Gaza and a significant portion of those in Sudan have missed over a year of education ([UNICEF, 2024](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/regular-attacks-put-gaza-schools-turned-shelters-frontlines-war)).  

- **Barriers:** Learning is halted not only by destruction but also by insecurity near schools, teacher displacement, and the use of school buildings as temporary shelters for displaced populations.  


#### B. Infrastructure Destruction  

The physical environment of learning is often under direct attack, making safe schooling impossible.  
(Source: [UN News – 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165417))  

- **Surge in Attacks:** Attacks on education infrastructure increased by a *“staggering 44 per cent”* in the past year ([United Nations, 2025 Report](https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Summary-of-the-Annual-Report-on-Children-and-Conflict.pdf)).  

- **Near-Total Loss:** Estimates indicate that **80% to 95%** of all school buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed ([UNICEF, 2024](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/regular-attacks-put-gaza-schools-turned-shelters-frontlines-war)).  

- **Human Cost:** Over **10,000 students, teachers, and academics** were harmed, injured, or killed in attacks on education globally in 2022 and 2023 ([GCPEA, 2024 – Education Under Attack Report](https://eua2024.protectingeducation.org/)).  


### 3. The Solar Intervention: A Resilient Educational Solution  

Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technology is uniquely suited to overcome the challenges of providing education in crisis settings due to its **resilience**, **cost efficiency**, and **ease of deployment**.  (Source: [University of Southampton, 2025](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/499266/1/1-s2.0-S0301479725000155-main.pdf))

#### A. Economic and Logistical Advantage over Diesel 

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** PV-battery systems are proven to be more cost-effective than diesel for essential services, often recovering their investment cost in a few years ([University of Southampton, 2025](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/499266/1/1-s2.0-S0301479725000155-main.pdf)).  

- **Operational Savings:** Large-scale solar systems, such as the solar-diesel hybrid in **Dadaab Refugee Camps (Kenya)**, saved up to **16,000 litres of diesel per month** ([Loughborough University, 2016](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/resources/conference/39/Ahmed-2495.pdf)), freeing up significant humanitarian funds.  

- **Fuel Security:** Solar eliminates reliance on the diesel supply chain, which is logistically complex, dangerous to transport, and easily disrupted or weaponized in conflict zones ([Chatham House, 2018](https://www.gov.uk/research-for-development-outputs/the-costs-of-fuelling-humanitarian-aid)).  


#### B. Case Studies in Resilience and Hope  

- **Jordan’s Azraq Camp (UNHCR):** Azraq became the **world's first clean energy refugee camp** with a **2MW solar plant** ([UNHCR, 2020](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/79057)). This power directly enabled refugees to study after dark and immediately saved UNHCR **$1.5 million per year** ([UNHCR, 2017](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/79057)), with savings reinvested into aid and job training for over **50 refugees** in solar installation and maintenance.  

- **Digital Learning:** Programs are successfully using solar power to run educational devices and offline content hubs in remote camps ([UNICEF, 2024](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/regular-attacks-put-gaza-schools-turned-shelters-frontlines-war)).  


### 4. Linking to the Dual-Use Solution (Architectural Vision)  

Because schools often serve as emergency community shelters, the energy system must support a unique, continuous, **24-hour staggered demand profile** (classroom by day / shelter by night). 
Solar energy is the only solution that can independently and cleanly support this continuous, dual functionality.  

A **Solar PV system with Battery Energy Storage (BES)** provides power for high daytime demands (IT, lighting) and then draws on stored energy overnight to run the facility when it shifts to a shelter function (e.g., medical lighting, communications).  

This hybrid, energy-independent setup ensures the educational infrastructure remains a **resilient and functional piece of critical infrastructure** throughout the crisis.

### 5. Conclusion: Solar Energy as a Foundation for Recovery  

In war-affected regions where centralized infrastructure is broken or targeted, **solar energy is not an option—it is a necessity** for the survival and recovery of the education sector.  
By providing reliable, decentralized power to schools, the humanitarian sector can protect the **fundamental right to education**, reduce long-term operational costs, and promote environmental sustainability—laying a **resilient foundation for long-term peace and reconstruction.**
