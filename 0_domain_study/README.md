> Of the 234 million school-age children affected by conflict globally, **85 million children are completely out of school.**

_The figures are “unprecedented,” Helena Murseli, who leads the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) Global Education in Emergencies team, told [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165417)_ _“These are not isolated incidents. They are part of a global pattern of escalating conflict that affects children's right to learn,” she said._

### [Background: Education in Crisis](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165417)
- Armed conflicts have left millions of children without schooling, eroding both their safety and future prospects. Education is not only vital for learning but also for stability, protection, and recovery in crisis settings.

  - Sudan faces the world’s largest education emergency, with 19 million children out of school and 90% of schools closed. UNICEF and partners are restoring access through Makanna centres, solar-powered learning tools, and a $400M UNESCO plan.
      - The organization also utilises solar-powered tablets for education, _“perfect for a country with more than 10 hours of daily sunshine,” said Ms. Murseli._
  - In Gaza, [95%](https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/59/26?_gl=1*dbrfff*_ga*MTYzMDA1NDk5OS4xNzU5NjU1MzA4*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*czE3NTk2NTUzMDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTk2NTU3OTAkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_S5EKZKSB78*czE3NTk2NTUzMDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTk2NTU3OTckajM0JGwwJGgw) of schools are destroyed, leaving [660,000](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-177-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem) children without education. Temporary spaces, recycled materials, and digital tools are being used to sustain learning for thousands.
  - In Ukraine, 5.3 million children face disrupted education, with many relying on online or hybrid learning amid attacks and power shortages. UNICEF supports safe underground classrooms and catch-up programs.

Despite urgent needs, education receives only 3% of humanitarian aid, even as funding is expected to drop further. Without investment, millions risk becoming a lost generation—deprived of the skills to rebuild their societies.

> In the short and long-term, the consequences of missing out on education during violent crises are severe.
