# Data Analysis: Guide

This folder is for any Python scripts or notebooks you use to gain insights from
your data through modeling, inferential statistics, and other analytical
techniques. These files should:

1. Read in prepared datasets from `0_datasets`
2. Learn from your datasets using methods that are appropriate to your research
   question, dataset and team's constraints.

**DO NOT modify an existing dataset in `0_datasets`!** This is critical to open
research: Someone should be able to clone this repository and run your scripts
to replicate your research. If you modify an original dataset, others cannot
replicate your work.

> [Chapters 5-8](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/artofdatascience) from the Art of
> Data Science are a good starting reference.

## README.md

Use the README in this folder to document your analysis strategy and provide a
quick summary of each script/notebook. You can also explain your research
results in-depth in this folder's README.
